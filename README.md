# Hearing Loss Type Weapon Sounds: Bryan's Hideous Destructor Weapons
Hearing loss-inducing gunshots for [Bryan's HDest Weapons](https://codeberg.org/_bryan/hdest-weapons).\
This mod is a smaller version of a larger private mod that is for the main game Hideous Destructor, thus the naming.\
\
Note: Some weapon sound files are currently unused until the code for these are currently updated to correctly reference them instead of reusing sounds from other weapons.
